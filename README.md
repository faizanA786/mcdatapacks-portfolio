# Minecraft Datapack Portfolio website

I created a portfolio website to showcase my custom Minecraft datapacks. Built with HTML and CSS, the website highlights each datapack with detailed descriptions and their corresponding download links. It serves as a centralized hub for players to explore my creations and easily access them.
